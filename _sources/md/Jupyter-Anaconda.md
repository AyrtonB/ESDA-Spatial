### What is Jupyter/Anaconda?

Anaconda is a platform for doing data science with that takes care of installing programming environments and packaging Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), whether that be RStudio or Jupyter Notebooks/Lab. The wider Jupyter tools (e.g. <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub">Jupyter Hub</a>) also make it easier to host individual coding environments. This allows people to start learning about coding for spatial analytics straight away, rather than how to set up the environment (which is covered in a parallel module).

Information on how to install Anaconda and set-up the environment can be found on the 'Setup' page of the wiki.
