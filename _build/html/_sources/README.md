# UCL Energy Systems & Data Analytics - Spatial Module
 
This repository contains set-up instructions, code, and general resources for the spatial module included in the UCL ESDA masters course. These materials have been rewritten and reformatted in order to make them as accessible as possible for remote teaching during lockdown. We have endeavoured to ensure the set-up is as easy as possible but for anyone who has problems please post in the Moodle forum or alternatively in the Github Issues for this repository.

The course materials can also be seen in book form <a href="https://ayrtonb.github.io/ESDA-Spatial">here</a>
