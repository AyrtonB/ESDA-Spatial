## Analysis Preparation

### Imports

All of these libraries should have been previously installed during the environment set-up, if they have not been installed already you can use ```install.packages(c("sf", "ggplot2"))```

```{r}
library(sf) # for handling spatial features
library(dplyr) # used for data manipulation
library(raster) # useful in some spatial operations
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(zeallot) # used for unpacking variables

source('../scripts/helpers.R') # helper script, note that '../' is used to change into the directory above the directory this notebook is in
```

### Loading Data

We'll start by again checking to see if we need to download any data
